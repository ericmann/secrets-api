/**
 * Secrets API: prototype-format fallback store (plugin-only, never copied to core)
 *
 * @package SecretsAPI
 */

/**
 * Serves a read whose new-format record does not exist yet from the prototype's
 * option row instead, upgrading it to the current format on the way through.
 *
 * The problem this solves is adoption, not compatibility. The AI plugin was built
 * on the prototype, so its sites have credentials sitting in prototype-format
 * rows. When that plugin moves to the Secrets API, every one of those sites would
 * otherwise see wp_get_secret() return null for a credential it demonstrably has,
 * and would need an explicit migration run -- per site -- before working again.
 * Sites that nobody remembers to migrate would simply break, and a credential that
 * cannot be re-entered from memory means a rebuild.
 *
 * So instead: a miss falls through to the prototype row, the value is re-encrypted
 * into a proper current-format record, and the caller gets a normal WP_Secret. The
 * next read hits the new record directly and never comes back here. The upgrade is
 * one-way and happens once per secret, on first use.
 *
 * Only the unnamespaced form participates. wp_get_secret( 'api_key' ) consults the
 * prototype's 'api_key'; wp_get_secret( 'myplugin/api_key' ) consults nothing,
 * because the prototype had no namespaces and so cannot have owned that name.
 * Nothing is rewritten or inferred -- see prototype_key_for().
 *
 * A note on what this is NOT. It does not implement the prototype's API, reinstate
 * its function names, or let prototype-era code keep running -- that would be a
 * compatibility layer, and there is deliberately none. It reads one option row,
 * once, and never writes to or deletes anything the prototype owns. Both systems
 * keep working on the same site throughout, because the two option namespaces do
 * not overlap.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Implemented as a decorator around whatever store would otherwise be active,
 * rather than as changes to WP_Secrets_Option_Store, for two reasons. Core has no
 * business knowing this format ever existed, and src/ stays a clean file-copy
 * candidate. And it composes: this wraps the default option store, and a
 * secrets.php drop-in that installs a host store replaces it entirely, which is
 * the right outcome -- a host serving secrets from its own platform has no
 * prototype rows to inherit.
